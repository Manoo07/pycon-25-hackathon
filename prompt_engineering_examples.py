Description: "Exchange server crashed. 500+ users cannot send/receive emails. Business critical."
ANALYSIS: agent_002|Alex Rodriguez has Windows_Server(9) and Active_Directory(10) skills with lowest load(1) and highest experience(12). Perfect for Exchange crisis.|Confidence: 95%

EXAMPLE 2 - Individual User Issue:
Ticket: "Cannot access SharePoint site"
Description: "Single user cannot open SharePoint documents. Gets 'Access Denied' error."

EXAMPLE 3 - Security Incident:
Ticket: "Suspicious network activity detected"
Description: "Firewall logs show unusual traffic patterns. Potential security breach investigation needed."
ANALYSIS: agent_003|Michael Lee has Network_Security(9) and Firewall(9) skills with security expertise. Higher load(3) acceptable for security priority.|Confidence: 90%

Determine if this is CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW based on business impact and urgency.

Step 2 - Skill Requirements:
Identify the specific technical skills needed to resolve this issue.

Step 3 - Agent Evaluation:
For each relevant agent, evaluate:
- Skill match score (0-10)
- Current workload impact
- Experience level for this type of issue
- Availability status

Step 4 - Final Decision:
Select the optimal agent and provide confidence score.
