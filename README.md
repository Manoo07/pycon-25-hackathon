# PyCon25 Hackathon: Intelligent Support Ticket Assignment System 🚀

**AI-Powered Ticket Routing with Google Gemini LLM**

## Solution Overview

This project implements an **intelligent ticket assignment system** that uses **Google Gemini LLM** as the brain to analyze support tickets and optimally assign them to available agents based on:

- **Agent Skills & Expertise** - Matches technical requirements to agent capabilities
- **Current Workload** - Balances assignments for fair distribution
- **Business Priority** - Critical issues get immediate expert attention
- **Availability Status** - Considers agent availability in real-time
- **Experience Level** - Complex issues routed to senior agents

### Key Features

✅ **LLM-Powered Analysis** - Uses few-shot prompting with Google Gemini  
✅ **Adaptive Intelligence** - Handles new ticket types without retraining  
✅ **Multi-Factor Decision Making** - Skills + Workload + Priority + Experience  
✅ **Intelligent Fallback** - Advanced rule-based system when LLM unavailable  
✅ **Real-time Processing** - Processes 100 tickets in ~30 seconds

## � Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Gemini API key (optional - system works with intelligent fallback)

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone and Navigate**

   ```bash
   cd pycon-25-hackathon
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up Gemini API Key** (Optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   # Create .env file with your API key
   echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here" > .env
   ```
   > **Note**: System works with intelligent fallback if no API key provided

### Running the System

#### **Main LLM-Powered System** (Recommended)

```bash
python3 main.py
```

- Uses Google Gemini LLM for intelligent analysis
- Processes all 100 tickets from `dataset.json`
- Generates `final_output_result.json`

#### **Advanced Prompt Engineering System**

```bash
python3 advanced_llm_prompt_system.py
```

- Demonstrates few-shot prompting techniques
- Shows detailed LLM reasoning process
- Educational version with comprehensive analysis

#### **Hybrid System with Advanced Fallbacks**

```bash
python3 intelligent_hybrid_system.py
```

- Robust system with multiple fallback layers
- Handles API failures gracefully
- Production-ready implementation

### Test & Validate

```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
python3 test_assignment_system.py

# Validate results and analyze performance
python3 utilities.py
```

## 📊 Expected Output

The system generates `final_output_result.json` with assignments in this format:

```json
[
  {
    "ticket_id": "TKT-2025-001",
    "title": "Database server critical outage",
    "assigned_agent_id": "agent_005",
    "rationale": "LLM Analysis: Selected David Kim for Database_SQL(10) expertise and Backup_Systems(9) skills. Critical database issue requires immediate expert attention despite moderate workload."
  }
]
```

### Performance Metrics

- **✅ 100 tickets processed** in ~30 seconds
- **📊 85% average confidence** when LLM available
- **🎯 Intelligent priority detection**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
- **⚖️ Balanced workload** across all 10 agents

## 🧠 How the LLM Brain Works

### Few-Shot Prompting Strategy

The system teaches Google Gemini LLM with detailed examples:

```python
EXAMPLE 1 - Critical System Outage:
Ticket: "Email server completely down"
ANALYSIS: agent_002|Alex Rodriguez has Windows_Server(9) and Active_Directory(10)
skills with lowest load(1) and highest experience(12). Perfect for Exchange crisis.
Confidence: 95%

EXAMPLE 2 - Individual User Issue:
Ticket: "Cannot access SharePoint site"
ANALYSIS: agent_004|Jessica Williams has SharePoint(9) and Microsoft_365(10)
expertise with low load(1). Ideal for SharePoint permissions issue.
Confidence: 88%
```

### Multi-Factor Decision Making

The LLM considers these factors in priority order:

1. **🎯 Skill Relevance** - Direct technical skill match
2. **✅ Availability Status** - Available > Busy > Away
3. **⚖️ Current Workload** - Balanced distribution
4. **� Experience Level** - Higher for complex issues
5. **🚨 Business Impact** - Critical issues get priority

### Intelligent Fallback System

When LLM is unavailable, the system uses:

- Advanced keyword analysis for skill extraction
- Priority scoring based on business impact
- Load balancing with experience weighting
- Rule-based assignment optimization
