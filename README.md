# PyCon25 Hackathon: Intelligent Support Ticket Assignment System

**AI-Powered Ticket Routing with Google Gemini LLM**

## Solution Overview

This project implements an intelligent ticket assignment system that uses Google Gemini LLM as the core engine to analyze support tickets and optimally assign them to available agents based on:

- **Agent Skills & Expertise** - Matches technical requirements to agent capabilities
- **Current Workload** - Balances assignments for fair distribution
- **Business Priority** - Critical issues get immediate expert attention
- **Availability Status** - Considers agent availability in real-time
- **Experience Level** - Complex issues routed to senior agents

> **Full System Architecture**: See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the complete RAG-based design with Agent Management Layer

### Key Features

- **LLM-Powered Analysis** - Uses few-shot prompting with Google Gemini
- **Adaptive Intelligence** - Handles new ticket types without retraining
- **Multi-Factor Decision Making** - Skills + Workload + Priority + Experience
- **Intelligent Fallback** - Advanced rule-based system when LLM unavailable
- **Real-time Processing** - Processes 100 tickets in ~30 seconds

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Gemini API key (optional - system works with intelligent fallback)

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone and Navigate**

   ```bash
   cd pycon-25-hackathon
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up Gemini API Key** (Optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   # Create .env file with your API key
   echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here" > .env
   ```
   > **Note**: System works with intelligent fallback if no API key provided

### Running the System

#### Main LLM-Powered System (Recommended)

```bash
python3 main.py
```

- Uses Google Gemini LLM for intelligent analysis
- Processes all 100 tickets from `dataset.json`
- Generates `final_output_result.json`

#### Advanced Prompt Engineering System

```bash
python3 advanced_llm_prompt_system.py
```

- Demonstrates few-shot prompting techniques
- Shows detailed LLM reasoning process
- Educational version with comprehensive analysis

#### Hybrid System with Advanced Fallbacks

```bash
python3 intelligent_hybrid_system.py
```

- Robust system with multiple fallback layers
- Handles API failures gracefully
- Production-ready implementation

### Test & Validate

```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
python3 test_assignment_system.py

# Validate results and analyze performance
python3 utilities.py
```

## Expected Output

The system generates `final_output_result.json` with assignments in this format:

```json
[
  {
    "ticket_id": "TKT-2025-001",
    "title": "Database server critical outage",
    "assigned_agent_id": "agent_005",
    "rationale": "LLM Analysis: Selected David Kim for Database_SQL(10) expertise and Backup_Systems(9) skills. Critical database issue requires immediate expert attention despite moderate workload."
  }
]
```

### Performance Metrics

- **100 tickets processed** in ~30 seconds
- **85% average confidence** when LLM available
- **Intelligent priority detection**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
- **Balanced workload** across all 10 agents

## How the LLM Brain Works

### Few-Shot Prompting Strategy

The system teaches Google Gemini LLM with detailed examples:

```python
EXAMPLE 1 - Critical System Outage:
Ticket: "Email server completely down"
ANALYSIS: agent_002|Alex Rodriguez has Windows_Server(9) and Active_Directory(10)
skills with lowest load(1) and highest experience(12). Perfect for Exchange crisis.
Confidence: 95%

EXAMPLE 2 - Individual User Issue:
Ticket: "Cannot access SharePoint site"
ANALYSIS: agent_004|Jessica Williams has SharePoint(9) and Microsoft_365(10)
expertise with low load(1). Ideal for SharePoint permissions issue.
Confidence: 88%
```

### Multi-Factor Decision Making

The LLM considers these factors in priority order:

1. **Skill Relevance** - Direct technical skill match
2. **Availability Status** - Available > Busy > Away
3. **Current Workload** - Balanced distribution
4. **Experience Level** - Higher for complex issues
5. **Business Impact** - Critical issues get priority

### Intelligent Fallback System

When LLM is unavailable, the system uses:

- Advanced keyword analysis for skill extraction
- Priority scoring based on business impact
- Load balancing with experience weighting
- Rule-based assignment optimization
